README:
Network Security Sam has encrypted his password. The encryption system 
is publically available.

KNOWELDGE:
This requires some logic.

SOLUTION:
I've got the encrypted password so I only need to undone that. Lets 
analyze the encryption. The first thing is that if I put 1 char it 
returns 1 char, the same for 2, 3 and so on and so forth. The second 
thing is that the first character it's always the same encrypted and 
unencrypted. The next thing is that if I put "aaa" it returns "abc". B 
is a+1 and c is a+2. It may be the same for other chars in other 
possitions. After some tests this is right. You can consult an ASCII 
table for those characters that aren't in the alphabet. You can 
unencrypt the password manually but I've created a program for that that 
you can find in the decrypter folder.
