README:
Network Security Sam set up a password protection script. He made it 
load the real password from an unencrypted text file and compare it to 
the password the user enters. However, he neglected to upload the 
password file...

SOLUTION:
If there's no password file and asuming the check is done with something 
similar to a if statement the webpage is comparing our attempt with a 
null or with an empty string. The first thing I tryed was sending and 
empty test. It worked.
