README:
This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password 
in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory.
In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output 
from the UNIX cal command.

SOLUTION:
So the password file is in the actual directory... And no, it's name it 
is not in the form.
Let's have a look to the script that returns cal text. I suppose it is 
something similar to this (for those who understand php):
<?php
echo system("cal ".$variable);
?>
The thing is that system executes the comand inside its parentesis which 
is the command cal+"what we write in the form". So if I put a ";" for 
separating the command cal I can execute anything I would want. For 
having a look at the things in the current directory I want to execute 
the command "ls" so I put ";ls" and it returns the files in the 
directory. Check their contents, one of that will give you the password.
