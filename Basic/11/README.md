There are no clues.


KNOWELDGE
---------

Basic Apache configuration. What .htaccess is. Understanding that the content of a web is closely related with passwords.


SOLUTION
--------

The only thing I can see is a changing name of a song in a plain webpage. Is it php? If I enter index.php in the url it shows a new page! It is better than nothing. At least I know where to put the password. There's nothing in source code again. I went back to index.html and searched a bit about the name of the songs. Every song was from Elton John so I tryed that in 100 ways and got nothing. After some frustration I started entering ramdon URLs and luckily found that /e/ was a valid folder. Clicking on what I found got to /e/l/t/o/n/ URL. Why not testing for apache files? Maybe .htaccess is present somwhere. /e/l/t/o/n/.htaccess is hidding a file called DaAnswer.* but the character '*' can represent any string so... Testing!/e/l/t/o/n/DaAnswer.txt shows "The answer is somewhere! Just look a little harder.". After som time I couldn't find anything else so I began thinking on something else... After a siesta I realised I had completed the challenge. "The answer is somewhere!", particularly "somewhere". 
Test it on index.php and boom!
