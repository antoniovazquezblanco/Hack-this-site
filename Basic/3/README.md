This time Network Security Sam remembered to upload the password file, but there were deeper problems than that.


KNOWELDGE
---------

HTML again. Something about what a form is and maybe read something about PHP.


SOLUTION
--------

My first idea was having a look at the form. In the form there was an hidden item. This item cointained the name of a file called "password.php". I copied the name in the URL and the password came up!
