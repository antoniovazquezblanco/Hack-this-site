README:
This time Sam hardcoded the password into the script. However, the 
password is long and complex, and Sam is often forgetful. So he wrote a 
script that would email his password to him automatically in case he 
forgot.

SOLUTION:
The last time having a look to the form worked so why not now. I had a 
look to the form again and another hidden field apeared containig an 
email. I changed the email and just used mine and it worked. The 
password came up.
