Message: Hey man, I need a big favour from you. Remember that website I 
showed you once before? Uncle Arnold's Band Review Page? Well, a long 
time ago I made a $500 bet with a friend that my band would be at the 
top of the list by the end of the year. Well, as you already know, two 
of my band members have died in a horrendous car accident... but this 
ass hole still insists that the bet is on!
I know you're good with computers and stuff, so I was wondering, is 
there any way for you to hack this website and make my band on the top 
of the list? My band is Raging Inferno. Thanks a lot, man!

KNOWELDGE:
Some HTML what a form is and how PHP will manage form data.

SOLUTION:
Let's find "Raging Inferno". It has a form just below that lets you 
select a value from one to five and send it. I think this is used to 
calculate a mean value that is used to select the order of the list. If 
this is correct the maximum value must be 5, so if they are in the worst 
case they would get a 0. They may become the best band if we can send a 
high value. This can be done by altering the form. Just change the value 
of one of the elements of the list and send the form. This should make 
them become the first in the list. If you don't know how to change the 
value just search for Firebug in Google.
