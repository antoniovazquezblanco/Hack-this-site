Message: I have been informed that you have quite admirable hacking skills. 
Well, this racist hate group is using their website to organize a mass 
gathering of ignorant racist bastards. We cannot allow such bigoted aggression 
to happen. If you can gain access to their administrator page and post messages 
to their main page, we would be eternally grateful.

KNOWELDGE:
HTML is always a must. Learning that you can extract a lot of information from 
the contents of a webpage. Something about SQL and how a loging is implemented 
in PHP and how can you bypass one.

SOLUTION:
The clue is that there's an admin panel, the question is where is it. After 
searching a bit I found a link to an "update.php" file. When I open the file I 
can see a login form. After trying multiple SQL injection options I remembered 
there were usernames in the posts published in the first page so I decided to 
try SQL injection with the user "WhiteKing" and I found a valid match in 
"' OR '1'='1".
