Faith is going to test your math skills and your javascript operations.


KNOWELDGE

Check function compares the number of characters of our input with the variable moo. This can be done in various ways. You can compute this operations with a calculator or use Firebug or any similar plugin for running the operations and showing the result with the alert command. In my case moo is 14 so I must introduce any string with 14 characters.
